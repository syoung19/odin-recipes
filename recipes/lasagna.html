    <h1>Lasagna Recipe</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A delicious meat-free lasagna as featured on the New York Times</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>12-16 dry lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>3-4 cups GOOD tomato sauce</li>
        <li>2 T Extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>3 cups cooked spinach, squeezed dry</li>
        <li>1.5 cups ricotta</li>
        <li>1.5 cups coarsley grated mozzarella</li>
        <li>2 cups grated parmesan</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>If you're using dried pasta, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. If you're using fresh pasta sheets, cut them into long wide noodles
             approximately 3 inches by 13 inches, or a size that will fit into your lasagna dish. Cook the noodles (6 at a time for dried noodles) 
             until they are tender but still underdone (they will finish cooking as the lasagna bakes); fresh pasta will take only a minute. 
             Drain and then lay the noodles flat on a towel so they won't stick.</li>
        <li>Heat the oven to 400 degrees. Grease a rectangular baking dish with the olive oil, add a large dollop of tomato sauce and spread it around. 
            Put a layer of noodles (use four) in the dish, trimming any overhanging edges; 
            top with a layer of tomato sauce, one-third of the spinach, and one-fourth of the ricotta (use your fingers to spread it evenly), 
            the mozzarella and the Parmesan. Season with salt and pepper if desired.</li> 
        <li>Repeat the layers twice, and top with the remaining noodles, tomato sauce, ricotta, mozzarella and Parmesan; 
            the top should be covered with cheese; add more ricotta and Parmesan as needed. (The lasagna may be made ahead to this point, 
            wrapped tightly and refrigerated for up to a day or frozen. Bring to room temperature before proceeding.)</li>
        <li>Bake until the lasagna is bubbling and the cheese is melted and lightly browned on top, about 30 minutes. 
            Remove from the oven and let rest a few minutes before serving, or cool completely, cover well, and refrigerate for up to 3 days,
             or freeze.</li>  
    </ol>
